            Team Aurora Borealis competed in the Catalyst Challenge for Rural Canada in August of 2021. The team wom the competition, winning a 12-month incubation with Ontario Tech University's Brilliant Catalyst. The team pitched Fiacre -- a solution to increasing connection and decreasing isolation in rural communities (notably in the Thunder Bay District), by implementing automated, electric public transit solutions.
