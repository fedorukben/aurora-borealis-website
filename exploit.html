            The Aurora Borealis team participated in the 2021 IBM DataJam Against Exploitation in May 2021. Although the team did not place in the top 3, we were happy to participate. We worked to create a series of genera discussing various policies to fight human trafficking, while taking into account that various jurisdictions will have differing optima/requirements. This realization was achieved using various data analysis, which produced an optimal freedom score for minimizing human trafficking.
