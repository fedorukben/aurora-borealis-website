            This <a href="flag-demo.zip" download>download link</a> will download a ZIP file containing a Python file (flag-demo.py) which, when run, will allow you to enter text and see if it gets flagged. You must unzip the directory somewhere known.<br><br>

            Please note, <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python 3</a> is required for this demo. The demo was written in Python 3.9.5. In order to initialize the program (and install any dependencies) you must run the following terminal command:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        </p>
        <p>
            You must then use the following command to run the file:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            python3 flag-demo.py
        </p>
        <p>
            Please keep in mind that you must ensure that your present working directory is the 'flag-demo' folder. <br><br>

            Please feel free to watch the following installation guides on YouTube to install the software. We have created installation guides for Windows, <a href="https://youtu.be/HqGmCQVW64w" target="_blank">macOS</a>, and Ubuntu/Linux.<br><br>

            If you are having troubles installing the program or do not wish to install the software, we invite you to click <a href="https://youtu.be/mg5f-t8T578" target="_blank">here</a> to watch a YouTube video demonstration of the program. <br><br>

            Thank-you for using our demonstration! We hope you gain a hands-on insight into the Plebeian Algorithm!
